A knowledge base essentially consists in a folder named <KB> containing (at 
least) two pairs of files.

The first pair is constituted by kb_csp_<KB> and kb_cop_<KB>. These are two 
"symmetric" files that encode the knwoledge bases for CSPs and COPs 
respectively. In particular, each of these file is a CSV file consisting of 
records of the form:

  inst|feat|info

where:

  - inst: is an unique identifier of the problem instance
  - feat: is the normalized feature vector [f'_1, ...f'_n'] of that instance,
          with f'_i in [-1, 1] for i = 1, ..., n'
  - info: is a dictionary of the form {s_1: I_1, ..., s_m: I_m} where:
      s_1, ..., s_m: are the solvers of the portfolio
      I_1, ..., I_m: are the infos of the solver s_i on the instance inst (i.e. 
                     the solver answer and the solving time)

The second pair of files, lims_csp_<KB> and lims_cops_<KB>, are instead python 
dictionaries of the form:
  {1: [min_1, max_1], ..., n: [min_n, max_n]}
where min_i and max_i are respectively the minimum and the maximum value of the 
i-th non-normalized feature over all the training instances of the corresponding 
knowledge base. If f_i is constant, the corresponding value in the dictionary is 
null. Note that n' = n - c, where c is the number of constants features.

The purpose of these files is to scale the features values of a 
new incoming instance in the range [-1, 1] avoiding to recompute for every new 
problem the minimum and the maximum value for each feature. Note that for every 
new problem, if the value of one of its extracted features f_i is:

  > max_i or +inf, we set the corresponding normalized feature f'_i to 1
  < min_i or -inf, we set the corresponding normalized feature f'_i to -1
              NaN, we set the corresponding normalized feature f'_i to -1

This design choice has been made for avoiding the re-normalization of the 
knowledge base if the value of a new feature f_i is not in [min_i, max_i].
This folder contains the default knowledge base kb_all.

kb_all is the 'original' knowledge base we retrieved, consisting of 5524 CSPs 
instances (4276 from Constraint Solving Competition 2008, 1233 from MiniZinc 1.6 
benchmarks, 3 from MiniZinc Challenge 2012, 12 from MiniZinc Challenge 2013) and 
4864 COPs (4763 from MiniZinc 1.6 benchmarks, 54 from MiniZinc Challenge 2012, 
and 47 from MiniZinc Challenge 2013). The solvers infos have been computed by 
considering a solving timeout of 1800 seconds.
