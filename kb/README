A knowledge base essentially consists in a folder named <KB> containing (at 
least) two pairs of files.

The first pair is constituted by kb_csp_<KB> and kb_cop_<KB>. These are two 
"symmetric" files that encode the knwoledge bases for CSPs and COPs 
respectively. In particular, each of these file is a CSV file consisting of 
records of the form:

  inst|feat|info

where:

  - inst: is an unique identifier of the problem instance
  - feat: is the normalized feature vector [f'_1, ...f'_n'] of that instance,
          with f'_i in [-1, 1] for i = 1, ..., n'
  - info: is a dictionary of the form {s_1: I_1, ..., s_m: I_m} where:
      s_1, ..., s_m: are the solvers of the portfolio
      I_1, ..., I_m: are the infos of the solver s_i on the instance inst, that 
                     is the solver answer and the solving time. The answer can 
                     be either 'sat' (satisfiable), 'uns' (unsatisfiable), 'opt' 
                     (the optimality of the solution is proven) or 'unk' 
                     (unknown). The solving time (in seconds) should be set to 
                     the solving timeout if the answer is 'unk' (or 'sat' for 
                     optimization problems).

The second pair of files, lims_csp_<KB> and lims_cops_<KB>, are instead python 
dictionaries of the form:
  {1: [min_1, max_1], ..., n: [min_n, max_n]}
where min_i and max_i are respectively the minimum and the maximum value of the 
i-th non-normalized feature over all the training instances of the corresponding 
knowledge base. If a feature f_i is constant over all the knowledge base, then 
f_i = null. Note that n' < n since the normalized feature vectors of the 
knowledge base don't contain constant features: if c is the number of constant 
features, then n = n' + c.

The purpose of these files is to scale the feature values of a new incoming 
instance in the range [-1, 1] avoiding to recompute for every new problem the 
minimum and the maximum value for each feature. Note that for every new problem 
if the value of one of its extracted features f_i is:

  >= max_i, we set the corresponding normalized feature f'_i to 1
  <= min_i, we set the corresponding normalized feature f'_i to -1
       NaN, we set the corresponding normalized feature f'_i to -1
       
Moreover, if f_i is a feature that is constant in the knowledge base it will be 
simply discarded, regardless of its value. 

This folder already contains the default knowledge base 'all'. This is the 
'original' knowledge base we retrieved, consisting of 5419 CSPs and 4860 COPs. 
The solvers infos have been computed by considering a solving timeout of 1800 
seconds.
