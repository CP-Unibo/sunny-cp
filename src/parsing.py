sunny-cp: a parallel CP portfolio solver. 

sunny-cp is a parallel portfolio solver able to solve a Constraint Satisfaction/
Optimization Problem defined in MiniZinc language by using the SUNNY algorithm.
In a nutshell, it relies on two sequential steps:

  1. PRE-SOLVING: consists in the parallel execution of a (possibly empty) 
                  static schedule and the feature extraction;
                  
  2. SOLVING: consists in the parallel execution of a number of predicted 
              solvers, (possibly) selected by means of SUNNY algorithm


USAGE: sunny-cp [OPTIONS] <MODEL.mzn> [DATA.dzn] 

WARNING: the order in [OPTIONS] matters! For instance, by typing the command:
         sunny-cp -p 1 -p 2 <MODEL.mzn> [DATA.dzn] the option -p will be set to 
         the value 2, since the the option -p 1 will be overwritten by -p 2.
  

Portfolio Options
=================
  -T <TIMEOUT>
    Timeout (in seconds) of SUNNY algorithm, used at runtime for predicting the 
    schedule of solvers to be run. Actually, T will be subtracted by C seconds 
    where C is the time taken by the pre-solving phase (i.e., static schedule 
    and feature extraction). Note that T IS NOT the timeout of the whole solving
    process: indeed, sunny-cp is an "anytime process", which is run indefinitely 
    until a solution is reached. So, the timeout of the whole solving process 
    has to be set externally by the user. The default value is T = 1200, the 
    same timeout of MiniZinc Challenge 2015. Also the constant +inf is allowed.
  -k <SIZE>
    Neighborhood size of SUNNY underlying k-NN algorithm. The default value of 
    k is the square root of the knowledge base size.
  -P <PORTFOLIO>
    Specifies the portfolio through a comma-separated list of solvers of the 
    form s_1,s_2,...,s_m. The specified ordering of solvers matters: indeed, 
    in case of failure of all the scheduled solvers, the other solvers will be 
    executed according to such ordering. By default, the portfolio includes all 
    the installed solvers.
  -A <SOLVERS>
    Adds to the default portfolio (or to the portfolio specified with -P option)
    the solvers in <SOLVERS>, which is a list of the form s_1,...,s_m.
  -R <SOLVERS>
    Removes from the default portfolio (or from the portfolio specified with -P 
    option) the solvers in <SOLVERS>, which is a list of the form s_1,...,s_m.
  -b <SOLVER>
    Set the backup solver of the portfolio. If the backup solver is not in the 
    specified portfolio, the first solver of the portfolio is selected. The 
    default backup solver is chuffed.
  --g12
    Use just the solvers of G12 platform, by using g12lazyfed as backup solver. 
    This is equivalent to set -P g12cbc,g12lazyfd,g12fd and -b g12lazyfd.
  -K <PATH>
    Absolute path of the folder which contains the knowledge base. The default 
    knowledge base is in kb/all_T1800. For more details, see the README file in 
    kb folder
  -s <SCHEDULE>
    Specifies a static schedule to be run before executing the SUNNY algorithm. 
    The schedule must be passed in the form: 
      s_1,t_1,s_2,t_2,...,s_m,t_m
    where each s_i belongs to the specified portfolio, and t_i is the timeout 
    (in seconds) for s_i. Note that in general when a timeout t_i expires the 
    solver s_i is not killed, but just suspended (and then resumed if s_i has to 
    run again later). The static schedule is empty by default. Also the constant
    +inf is allowed for the times t_i.
  -e <EXTRACTOR>
    Feature extractor used by sunny-cp. By default is "mzn2feat", but it can be 
    changed by defining a corresponding class in src/features.py.
  -a
    Prints to standard output all the solutions of the problem  (for CSPs only).
    or all the sub-optimal solutions until the optimum is found (for COPs only).
  -f
    Free search: ignore any search annotation on the solve item.
  -p <CORES>
    The number of cores to use in the solving process. By default, is the number 
    of CPUs in the system
  -m <MEM_PERCENTAGE>
    Sets the maximum memory limit (in percentage) for sunny-cp solving process. 
    By default, this value is set to 100%, since the memory check can be pretty 
    resource consuming: it is suggested to set a value lower than 100 only if 
    you are sure that the solving process can be very memory consuming.
  -l <BOUND>
    Sets a lower bound for the problem to be solved (for COPs only). This is 
    equivalent to add the constraint f(x) >= <BOUND> where f(x) is the objective 
    function of the problem.
  -u <BOUND>
    Sets an upper bound for the problem to be solved (for COPs only). This is 
    equivalent to add the constraint f(x) <= <BOUND> where f(x) is the objective 
    function of the problem.

Solvers Options
===============
  --check-solvers <UNT_1>,<TRU_1>,...,<UNT_k>,<TRU_k>
    Checks the outcome of k "untrusted" solvers UNT_i by means of k "trusted" 
    solvers TRU_i for i = 1, ..., k. In particular:
    - if the outcome of UNT_i is =====UNBOUNDED===== or ====UNSATISFIABLE===== 
      then the outcome is ignored and nothing is printed;
    - if UNT_i produces a solution, sunny-cp exploits its FlatZinc output for 
      checking such solution by using TRU_i. If an inconsistency is detected,
      UNT_i is killed. Otherwise, the solution is printed;
    - If UNT_i proves the optimality, then the optimal solution is checked as 
      described above. However, line ========== is never printed (even when the 
      solution is sound);
    - In all the other cases (including failures of TRU_i) we assume that UNT_i 
      gives a correct answer, and thus the corresponding solution is printed.
    Note that checked solutions can be partial, since the variable assignments 
    considered in the solution check are all and only those printed by UNT_i 
    on standard output. So, the solution check also depends on the output 
    annotations defined by the user in the MiniZinc model. This option clearly 
    introduces an overhead in the solving process, especially for problems where 
    UNT_i produces a lot of sub-optimal solutions or TRU_i is not performant. 
    *** NOTE ***: This option, unset by default, only works with MiniZinc 2.x. 
    While UNT_i must be different from TRU_i, it is however possible to have 
    UNT_i = UNT_j or TRU_i = TRU_j for some distinct indexes i, j in {1, ..., k}
  --fzn-options "<OPTIONS>"
    Allows to run each solver of the portfolio on its specific FlatZinc model by
    using the options specified in <OPTIONS> string. No checks are performed on 
    that string. This setting does not overwrite the current options string, but
    just append <OPTIONS> to it. By default, the options string is empty.
  --fzn-options-<SOLVER_NAME> "<OPTIONS>"
    As above, with the difference that <OPTIONS> are set only for <SOLVER_NAME> 
    and not for all the solvers of the portfolio. 
  --wait-time <TIME>
    Don't stop a running solver if it has produced a solution in the last <TIME> 
    seconds. By default, <TIME> is 2 seconds. Also the constant +inf is allowed
  --wait-time-<SOLVER> <TIME>
    Don't stop <SOLVER> if it has produced a solution in the last <TIME> seconds  
  --restart-time <TIME>
    Restart a constituent solver if its best solution is obsolete and it has not 
    produced a solution in the last <TIME> seconds. 
    By default, <TIME> is 5 seconds. Also the constant +inf is allowed.
  --restart-time-<SOLVER> <TIME>
    Restart <SOLVER> if its best solution is obsolete and it has not produced a 
    solution in the last <TIME> seconds
  --switch-search
    Allows to switch the search from fixed search to free search (and viceversa) 
    when solvers are restarted. Of course, this holds just for the solvers that 
    allow both free and fixed search. This option in unset by default.
  --switch-search-<SOLVER_NAME>
    As above, with the difference that search is switched only for <SOLVER_NAME> 
    and not for all the solvers of the portfolio.
  --max-restarts <MAX>
    Sets the maximum number of times a solver can be restarted. After <MAX> 
    restarts, the solver is killed rather than being restarted for the 
    (<MAX> + 1)-th time.
    By default, <MAX> = +inf
  --max-restarts-<SOLVER>
    As above, with the difference that the option is set only for <SOLVER_NAME> 
    and not for all the solvers of the portfolio.
    
Helper Options
==============
  -h, --help
    Print this message
  -d <PATH> 
    Absolute path of the folder in which the temporary files created by the 
    solver will be put. The default directory is tmp, and by default such files 
    are deleted after sunny-cp execution      
  --keep
    Do not erase the temporary files created by the solver and stored in the 
    specified directory (useful for debugging). This option is unset by default    
  --csp-<OPTION> <VALUE>
    Allows to set the specific option only if the input problem is a CSP. Note 
    that the '-' character of <OPTION> must be omitted. For example, --csp-T 900 
    set the T parameter to 900 only if the problem is a CSP, while such option 
    is ignored if the problem is a COP.
  --cop-<OPTION> <VALUE>
    Allows to set the specific option only if the input problem is a COP. Note 
    that the '-' character of <OPTION> must be omitted. For example, --cop-T 900 
    set the T parameter to 900 only if the problem is a COP, while such option 
    is ignored if the problem is a COP.
