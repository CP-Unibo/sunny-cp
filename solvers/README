sunny-cp provide utilities to add new solvers to its portfolio, provided that 
each specified solver is already usable via the MiniZinc command line (for more 
information, please see [1]). That is, a solver called <SOLVER> can be part of
sunny-cp portfolio if it can compile a MiniZinc model with the command:
   
  minizinc -c --solver <SOLVER> <model>.mzn [<data>.mzn]
  
and it can solve a FlatZinc instance with the command:

  minizinc --solver <SOLVER> <instance>.fzn

Let us suppose that we want to add a new solver called <SOLVER>. The first step 
is to define a file named <SOLVER>.solv in this folder. This file is a json file
of the form:

{
  'versions': [
    {
      'id': '<...>'
      'name': '<...>'
      'conv_opts': '<...>'
      'solv_opts': '<...>'
    },
    {
      'id': '<...>'
      'name': '<...>'
      'conv_opts': '<...>'
      'solv_opts': '<...>'
    },
    ...
  ]
}

containing a list of n >= 1 different versions of <SOLVER>. Each version must: 
- have a unique identifier (the 'id' field)
- specify a symbolic name for that version (the 'name' field)
- specify the command line options for the MiniZinc/FlatZinc conversion (the 
  'conv_opts' field) and the FlatZinc execution (the 'solv_opts' field). If no 
  specific option is required, just set these fields to the empty string ''.
In this way, one can include in the portfolio different versions of the same 
solver without defining one .solv file per version.

Once the .solv files are defined, run make_pfolio.py to (re-)generate the file 
pfolio_solvers.py.

Note that make_pfolio.py is already invoked when installing sunny-cp via the
script install.sh, so there is no need to run it again if we are not adding any 
new solver to the default portfolio.
