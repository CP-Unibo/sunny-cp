The sunny-cp package does not contain neither the sources and the binaries of    
its constituent solvers, that should be installed separately. However, sunny-cp
provides utilities for adding the installed solvers to its portfolio and for 
customizing their settings.

Let us suppose that we want to install a solver called <SOLVER> and that 
<SUNNY_HOME> is the root folder of sunny-cp. The suggested procedure *before 
installing sunny-cp* is to:

 1. create a corresponding folder: <SUNNY_HOME>/solvers/<SOLVER>
  
 2. create a folder <SUNNY_HOME>/solvers/<SOLVER>/mzn-lib which contains the 
    solver-specific redefinitions of the MiniZinc global constraints
    (also a symbolic link to another folder is fine)
    
 3. create an executable file <SUNNY_HOME>/solvers/<SOLVER>/fzn-exec which 
    invokes the command used by <SOLVER> to execute its FlatZinc interpreter
    (also a symbolic link to another executable is fine)
    
 4. create a text file <SUNNY_HOME>/solvers/<SOLVER>/opts which contains two    
    lines of the form:
      all_opt = '<OPTION>'
      free_opt = '<OPTION>'
    where:
      all_opt:  is the solver-specific option for printing all the solutions 
                (for CSPs only) or all the sub-optimal solutions (for COPs only)
      free_opt: is the solver-specific option for the free search (i.e., for 
                ignore the search annotations)
    Note that OPTION can also be empty; e.g., if a solver always ignores the 
    search annotations then just set free_opt = ''
    
 4. run the <SUNNY_HOME>/install.sh script for checking <SOLVER> installation
  
If this procedure succeeds, the following code will be added to the file 
<SUNNY_HOME>/src/pfolio_solvers.py:

  <SOLVER> = Solver()
  <SOLVER>.name = '<SOLVER>'
  <SOLVER>.mznlib = '<SUNNY_HOME>/solvers/<SOLVER>/mzn-lib'
  <SOLVER>.fzn_exec = '<SUNNY_HOME>/solvers/<SOLVER>/fzn-exec'
  <SOLVER>.constraint = <SOLVER> redefinition of the constraint LHS < RHS
  <SOLVER>.all_opt = <SOLVER> option string for printing all the solutions
  <SOLVER>.free_opt = <SOLVER> option string for free search
  
In this way, <SOLVER> object becomes part of the sources and usable by sunny-cp 
for the <SOLVER> execution. Note that once <SOLVER> is installed, it is however 
possible to modify its settings by manipulating the corresponding parameters in 
<SUNNY_HOME>/src/pfolio_solvers.py
Note that now there is no more a default portfolio: when not better specified, 
the default portfolio consists of the solvers defined in the sunny-cp/solvers 
directory. Actually, sunny-cp already comes with the folders corresponding to 
the built-in solvers of MiniZinc 2.0, namely: g12cbc, g12fd, and g12lazyfd.
Moreover, a (new) solver can be added, modified, or removed even after the 
sunny-cp installation: it is enough to follow the above steps 1-3 and then run 
the python script <SUNNY_HOME>/solvers/make_pfolio.py in place of step 4 (for 
avoiding the recompilation of all the other sources). Finally, note that all the 
solvers must have unique names and that every sub-folder of <SUNNY_HOME>/solvers 
is supposed to contain one and only one solver.
